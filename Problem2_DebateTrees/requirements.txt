# Requirements for ideatrix Assessment
# Data Scientist Intern Take-Home Assessment
# LLM-Based Reasoning Systems with MCTS and Cognitive Enhancement

# Core Python packages (usually included in standard Python)
# No external API dependencies required

# Optional visualization dependencies
matplotlib>=3.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# Note: All core functionality works without external dependencies
# The implementations use only Python standard library:
# - typing (type hints)
# - dataclasses (data structures)
# - enum (enumerations)
# - json (data serialization)
# - time (timing measurements)
# - random (randomization)
# - math (mathematical operations)
# - itertools (iteration utilities)
# - collections (specialized containers)

# For enhanced visualization (optional):
# matplotlib - creates performance charts and research analysis plots
# numpy - statistical calculations and array operations

# Installation:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or minimal installation (visualization disabled):
# No installation required - uses Python standard library only
