Advanced Monte Carlo Tree Search with Large Language Model Guidance for Constraint Satisfaction Problems

A comprehensive research implementation and empirical analysis of LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search applied to the classic Zebra Logic Puzzle, featuring enhanced state representation, hybrid algorithmic approaches, and rigorous comparative evaluation.

## Research Objectives

This project addresses fundamental questions in AI reasoning by implementing and evaluating novel hybrid approaches that combine:

- LLM Semantic Reasoning: Leveraging language models for domain-specific constraint understanding
- Enhanced MCTS: Advanced tree search with constraint-aware exploration strategies
- Hybrid Architectures: Two-phase approaches integrating constraint propagation with neural guidance
- Empirical Analysis: Comprehensive performance evaluation across multiple algorithmic paradigms

### Core Research Questions

- Can LLM semantic reasoning meaningfully improve MCTS performance on logic puzzles?
- How does constraint propagation integration affect LLM-MCTS effectiveness?
- What are the optimal trade-offs between pure algorithmic and hybrid LLM approaches?
- When should practitioners choose neural vs. symbolic approaches for CSP problems?

## Problem Domain: The Zebra Puzzle

The Zebra Puzzle serves as an ideal testbed for constraint satisfaction research, featuring:

- 5 houses × 5 attributes = 25 variables
- 15 logical constraints with complex interdependencies
- Search space: 5!^5 = 24,883,200,000 possible configurations
- Real-world relevance: Similar to scheduling, planning, and resource allocation problems

### Puzzle Attributes

- Nationalities: Norwegian, Ukrainian, Englishman, Spaniard, Japanese
- House Colors: Yellow, Blue, Red, Ivory, Green
- Beverages: Water, Tea, Milk, Orange Juice, Coffee
- Cigarettes: Kools, Chesterfields, Old Gold, Lucky Strike, Parliaments
- Pets: Fox, Horse, Snails, Dog, Zebra

**Research Goal:** Determine who drinks water and who owns the zebra using various AI approaches.

## Methodology and Implementation
