# Research Analysis: Enhanced LLM-MCTS for Zebra Puzzle

## Detailed Methodology and Technical Implementation

### 1. Problem Formalization

#### 1.1 Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Definition

The Zebra Puzzle is formalized as a CSP with:
- **Variables**: X = {x_{i,j} | i ∈ [1,5], j ∈ [1,5]} where i represents houses and j represents attributes
- **Domains**: D = {D_0, D_1, D_2, D_3, D_4} for nationalities, colors, drinks, cigarettes, and pets
- **Constraints**: C = {c_1, c_2, ..., c_{15}} representing the 15 logical rules

#### 1.2 State Space Analysis

- **Total configurations**: 5!^5 = 24,883,200,000
- **Valid solutions**: Typically 1 unique solution
- **Branching factor**: Average 5-15 actions per state
- **Search depth**: Maximum 25 decisions

### 2. Enhanced State Representation

#### 2.1 Domain Tracking Mechanism

```python
class EnhancedZebraPuzzleState:
    def __init__(self):
        # Core assignment matrix: houses × attributes
        self.assignments = [[None for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]
        
        # Domain constraints: (house, attribute) → set of valid values
        self.domains = {}
        
        # Constraint satisfaction tracking
        self.satisfied_constraints = set()
        self.violated_constraints = set()
```

**Key Innovation**: Explicit domain tracking allows for:
- Real-time constraint propagation
- Efficient pruning of invalid branches
- Early detection of constraint violations

#### 2.2 Constraint Propagation Algorithm

**Multi-Phase Propagation**:
1. **Same-House Constraints**: Enforce co-location requirements
2. **Adjacency Constraints**: Handle neighbor relationships
3. **Ordering Constraints**: Manage sequential relationships
4. **Forced Assignments**: Apply unit propagation when domains reduce to size 1

**Convergence Criteria**:
- Maximum 10 propagation rounds
- Early termination when no domain changes occur
- Failure detection when domains become empty

#### 2.3 Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) Heuristic

```python
def get_legal_actions(self) -> List[Tuple[int, int, str]]:
    # Prioritize positions with smallest domains
    empty_positions = []
    for house in range(5):
        for attr in range(5):
            if self.assignments[house][attr] is None:
                domain_size = len(self.domains[(house, attr)])
                empty_positions.append((domain_size, house, attr))
    
    empty_positions.sort()  # Sort by domain size (MRV)
```

### 3. Enhanced LLM Oracle Design

#### 3.1 Semantic Knowledge Base

**Constraint Rule Categories**:
- **Same-House Rules**: 8 co-location constraints
- **Adjacency Rules**: 3 neighbor relationships
- **Ordering Rules**: 1 sequential constraint
- **Fixed Assignments**: 2 initial constraints

**Knowledge Representation**:
```python
self.constraint_rules = {
    "same_house": [
        ("Englishman", "red", "The Englishman lives in the red house"),
        ("Spaniard", "dog", "The Spaniard owns the dog"),
        # ... additional constraints
    ],
    "adjacency": [
        ("Norwegian", "blue", "The Norwegian lives next to the blue house"),
        # ... adjacency constraints
    ]
}
```

#### 3.2 Multi-Factor Action Evaluation

**Evaluation Components**:

1. **Constraint Completion Bonus** (0.0-0.4):
   ```python
   def _evaluate_constraint_completion(self, state, action) -> float:
       # Check if action completes a known constraint pairing
       # Higher bonus for constraint satisfaction
   ```

2. **Semantic Consistency Bonus** (0.0-0.3):
   ```python
   def _evaluate_semantic_consistency(self, state, action) -> float:
       # Evaluate action against semantic knowledge
       # E.g., Norwegian in first house, milk in middle house
   ```

3. **Domain Reduction Bonus** (0.0-0.2):
   ```python
   def _evaluate_domain_reduction(self, state, action) -> float:
       # Measure search space reduction caused by action
       # Prefer actions that eliminate many possibilities
   ```

4. **Position Strategy Bonus** (0.0-0.3):
   ```python
   def _evaluate_position_strategy(self, state, action) -> float:
       # Strategic value based on domain size
       # Higher bonus for forced moves (domain size = 1)
   ```

#### 3.3 Temperature-Controlled Action Selection

```python
def get_action_distribution(self, state, actions) -> List[float]:
    scores = [self.evaluate_action_semantically(state, action) for action in actions]
    temperature = 0.7  # Controls exploration vs exploitation
    
    # Apply softmax with temperature
    exp_scores = [math.exp(score / temperature) for score in scores]
    total = sum(exp_scores)
    return [exp_score / total for exp_score in exp_scores]
```

### 4. Enhanced MCTS Algorithm

#### 4.1 Node Structure and UCB1 Enhancement

```python
class EnhancedMCTSNode:
    def ucb1_score(self, exploration_param: float = 1.41) -> float:
        if self.visits == 0:
            return float('inf')
        
        exploitation = self.total_reward / self.visits
        exploration = exploration_param * math.sqrt(math.log(self.parent.visits) / self.visits)
        constraint_bonus = 0.1 * self.constraint_satisfaction_score
        
        return exploitation + exploration + constraint_bonus
```

**Key Enhancement**: Constraint satisfaction score integrated into UCB1 for better node selection.

#### 4.2 LLM-Guided Expansion

**Expansion Strategy**:
1. Limit candidate actions to top 8 most promising
2. Use LLM oracle to compute action probability distribution
3. Apply weighted random selection based on probabilities
4. Create child node and update tree structure

**Efficiency Optimization**:
- Action limiting prevents exponential expansion
- LLM guidance focuses search on promising branches
- Early pruning of invalid states

#### 4.3 Enhanced Simulation (Rollout)

**Simulation Strategy**:
```python
def _enhanced_simulation(self, state: EnhancedZebraPuzzleState) -> float:
    if state.is_terminal():
        return 1.0
    
    sim_state = state.copy()
    moves = 0
    max_moves = 8  # Limited depth for efficiency
    
    while not sim_state.is_terminal() and moves < max_moves:
        actions = sim_state.get_legal_actions()
        if not actions:
            break
            
        # Use LLM guidance for action selection in simulation
        if len(actions) <= 6:
            action_probs = self.llm_oracle.get_action_distribution(sim_state, actions)
            action = weighted_random_selection(actions, action_probs)
        else:
            action = actions[0]  # Take first valid action for efficiency
            
        sim_state = sim_state.apply_action(action)
        moves += 1
    
    # Return completion-based reward
    if sim_state.is_terminal() and sim_state.is_valid():
        return 1.0
    else:
        return 0.8 * sim_state.get_constraint_satisfaction_score()
```

### 5. Hybrid Architecture Design

#### 5.1 Two-Phase Approach

**Phase 1: Constraint Propagation Preprocessing**
```python
def _aggressive_constraint_propagation(self, state) -> EnhancedZebraPuzzleState:
    working_state = state.copy()
    
    for round_num in range(20):
        old_completion = working_state.get_completion_ratio()
        working_state._propagate_constraints()
        new_completion = working_state.get_completion_ratio()
        
        # Convergence check
        if abs(new_completion - old_completion) < 0.01:
            break
            
        if working_state.is_terminal():
            break
            
    return working_state
```

**Phase 2: LLM-Guided MCTS on Reduced Problem**
- Adaptive time allocation based on preprocessing results
- Fallback to partial solutions if complete solution not found
- Resource allocation: 70% constraint propagation, 30% MCTS

#### 5.2 Performance Metrics

**Success Metrics**:
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of complete, valid solutions
- **Completion Rate**: Average percentage of puzzle completed
- **Execution Time**: Wall-clock time to solution or timeout
- **Reliability Score**: Consistency across multiple trials

**Composite Scoring**:
```python
def calculate_composite_score(result):
    max_time = get_max_time_across_algorithms()
    speed_score = (max_time - result["avg_time"]) / max_time * 100
    
    composite = (result["success_rate"] * 0.4 +
                 speed_score * 0.3 +
                 result["reliability"] * 0.3)
    return composite
```
